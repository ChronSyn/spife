^ hi, I'm chris.
thank you for having me!
I work on the npm registry remotely from sunny Portland.
Well, Portland.

# why npm built a framework

^ today I'm here to talk to you about "why npm built a framework"
^ did you know...

---

### the npm registry serves
# [fit] 11MM users

^ we serve 11MM people.
something like 20-30K requests per second.
(less now that npm5 is a thing. you're using npm5, right?)
but did you know!

---

### 13 engineers serve
# [fit] 11MM users

^ there's only thirteen people at npm who work on services.
and...

---

### 5 support techs serve
# [fit] 11MM users

^ five support techs.

---

# 😱

^ that's a pretty tough ratio to navigate.

---

# [fit] **HOW**

^ so, how do we do it?

---

# 🍴

^ we cut the problem up into services that talk REST-ful HTTP
now, as you know, there's a lot of room for interpretation there. and
a lot of this interpretation is to the side of the problem at hand.

---

# [fit] spife
### 🍴combination **knife** + **spoon**🍴
#### _(something no one asked for)_

^ we built a framework.
it's called spife! not a knife, not a spoon, but _both_. self-deprecatingly
named after something _nobody asked for_.

---

![spife](./spife.png)

^ for example: in the best case you get soup on your hands, in the worst, well
it doesn't bear mentioning, especially if you like gesticulating wildly like I do.

---

![inline](./switchspife.jpg)

^ we want something more like this. A switchblade spoon. A switchspoon.

---

# why write a framework?

^ you will instinctively ask "why did you write a framework?"

---

## restify is **great**
## hapi is **awesome**
## express is **wonderful**

^ we use (or used) all of these. other frameworks are great. But they were all built under different
language constraints, for companies facing different problems than the
ones npm faces.

---

# our **platform**
# [fit] is changing

^
Node is changing.
- Native promise support has been introduced.
- New V8 versions are being picked up more frequently, making new language
features available.
- and the LTS schedule makes it easier to know what to support.

---

# our **language**
# [fit] is changing

^
- JS in 2018 is a much more expressive language with better primitives
  than it has ever had before
- this means new APIs are possible.

---

# our **ecosystem**
# [fit] is growing

^ over the last few years there have been great
efforts around building reusable framework packages
express (under "jshttp") and hapi both make their constituent parts available
for reuse.

---

# 🐍

^ and another reason lurks...

---

### I **♥**
# [fit] django

^ I grew up on Django.

---

### I **♥**
# [fit] django

^ If you're not familiar with Django, it is a Python web framework that was
built by a newspaper company in Lawrence, Kansas. A small team of engineers

^ Django's motto is:

---

### I **♥**
# [fit] django

^
"The framework for perfectionists with deadlines." And I think Django lived up to its motto.

---

### **I don't miss**
# [fit] django
### in particular

^I don't miss Django in particular — if you're more familiar with Rails you may be able to comiserate.
- I miss how easy it was to build a site.
- I miss the clarity of knowing what functionality went where.
- And I really miss being able to respond to a request just by returning a value from a function.

---

So what are Spife's priorities?

---

## make doing the
# [fit] easy thing
## the same as doing the
# [fit] right thing

^ identify the intersection of your most common tasks with your
most involved tasks. Seek to make those tasks easy.

---

# restrict
### expressiveness
# to gain
# [fit] functionality

^ The most flexible materials aren't the easiest materials to work with.
Building your own cabinet out of materials you source is flexible. IKEA is less
expressive, but you'll have a cabinet faster.

---

> A good idea is something that does not solve just one single problem, but rather can solve multiple problems at once.
-- Shigeru Miyamoto

^ Shigeru Miyamoto, the designer of the Mario series (among others), said this in 2010.

do not mind being the consistent foolish little hobgoblin

## 🍴 hello spife🍴 

^ So what does spife look like?

---

```bash
$ npx @npm/spife init project my-first-project
```

^ Use `npx` to start a project.

---

```
.
├── bin
│   └── manage.js
├── lib
│   ├── apps
│   ├── routes.js
│   ├── settings.js
│   └── views.js
├── package-lock.json
├── package.json
└── test
```

^ It'll scaffold a directory.

---

`bin/manage.js runserver`

^ Run the application like so.

---

# routing

---

```javascript
const routes = require('@npm/spife/routing')

module.exports = routes`
  GET / myView
`(require('./views.js'))
```

---

```javascript
const routes = require('@npm/spife/routing')

const numbers = routes.param('numbers', Number)

module.exports = routes`
  GET     /             myView
  GET     /${numbers}   myNumbers
`(require('./views.js'))
```

---

```javascript
const routes = require('@npm/spife/routing')

const numbers = routes.param('numbers', value => {
  value = Number(value)
  if (value % 2 === 0) {
    throw new Error('not a valid number')
  }
  return value
})

module.exports = routes`
  GET     /             myView
  GET     /${numbers}   myNumbers
`(require('./views.js'))
```

---

`bin/manage.js init app books lib/apps/books`

const numbers = routes.param('numbers', Number)

module.exports = routes`
  *       /books        books     # include the book routes
  GET     /             myView
  GET     /${numbers}   myNumbers
`({
  ...require('./views.js'),
  books: require('./apps/books/routes')
})
```

---

# view functions

^ JS Modules are your controllers and views are your controller methods.

---

```javascript
module.exports = {myView}

function myView (req, context) {
  return {hello: 'world'}
}
```

^
- return objects for json, strings for, well, strings
- return nothing for a `204 No Content`

---

```javascript
module.exports = {myView}

async function myView (req, context) {
  const target = await req.body.get('target')
  return {hello: target}
}
```

^
- return a promise for any of the above, that's fine too
- `req.body` returns a promise for the parsed request body

---

```javascript
const reply = require('@npm/spife/reply')

module.exports = {myView}

async function myView (req, context) {
  const target = await req.body.get('target')
  return reply.status({hello: target}, 203)
}
```

^
- control headers and statuses using `reply`
- `reply` adds a well-known `Symbol` to your response


---

```javascript
const reply = require('@npm/spife/reply')

module.exports = {myView}

async function myView (req, context) {
  const target = await req.body.get('target')
  if (target !== 'world') {
    throw new Error('oh no')
  }

  return reply.status({hello: target}, 203)
}
```

^
- throw errors! that's okay

---

```javascript
const reply = require('@npm/spife/reply')

module.exports = {myView}

async function myView (req, context) {
  const target = await req.body.get('target')
  if (target !== 'world') {
    throw reply(new Error('oh no'), 400, {
      'cache-control': 'private'
    })
  }

  return reply.status({hello: target}, 203)
}
```

^
- you can control the status/headers of errors, too

---

# middleware

---

```javascript
// lib/middleware/redis.js
module.exports = myMiddleware

const redis = require('redis')

function myMiddleware ({redisUrl}) {
  return {
    async processServer (server, next) {
    },
    async processRequest (req, next) {
    }
  }
}
```

---

```javascript
module.exports = myMiddleware

const redis = require('redis')

function myMiddleware ({redisUrl}) {
  let client = null
  return {
    async processServer (server, next) {
      client = redis.createClient(redisUrl)
      await next()
      client.end({flush: false})
    },
    async processRequest (req, next) {
    }
  }
}
```

---

```javascript
module.exports = myMiddleware

const redis = require('redis')

function myMiddleware ({redisUrl}) {
  let client = null
  return {
    async processServer (server, next) {
      client = redis.createClient(redisUrl)
      await next()
      client.end({flush: false})
    },
    async processRequest (req, next) {
      req.redisClient = client
      return next(req)
    }
  }
}
```

---

# 4 available lifecycles:

- `processServer`
- `processRequest`
- `processView`
- `processBody`

---

# ORM

---

```javascript
// lib/apps/books/models/book.js
const orm = require('@npm/spife/db/orm')
const joi = require('@npm/spife/joi')
const Author = require('./author')

class Book {
  constructor ({id, author_id, author, title}) {
    this.id = id
    this.author_id = author_id
    this.author = author
    this.title = title
  }
}

Book.objects = orm(Book, {
  id: joi.number().integer().greater(-1).required(),
  author: orm.fk(Author),
  title: joi.string()
})

module.exports = Book
```

---

```javascript
// lib/apps/books/views.js
const Book = require('./models/book')

module.exports = myView

async function myView (req, context) {
  let books = Book.objects.all()
  return books
}
```

---

```javascript
const Book = require('./models/book')

module.exports = myView

async function myView (req, context) {
  let books = Book.objects.all()

  if (req.query.author) {
    books = books.filter({
      'author.name:contains': req.query.author
    })
  }

  return books
}
```

---

```javascript
const Book = require('./models/book')
const pagination = require('@npm/spife/views/paginate')

module.exports = myView

async function myView (req, context) {
  let books = Book.objects.all()

  if (req.query.author) {
    books = books.filter({
      'author.name:contains': req.query.author
    })
  }

  return pagination(req, context, {
    queryset: books
  })
}
```

---

other stuff:

- hot reloading
- webpack middleware (spife-webpack)
- token bucket ratelimiting (spife-ratelimit)
- csrf & csp middleware
- etc etc

---

### but what do we use
# [fit] spife
### for, these days?

---

- a file processing queue
- a lot of our caching services
- our SaaS billing system
- our user database
- and, well

---

# [fit] `preview.npmjs.com`

---

# [fit] to summarize

---

# make tools that align with your
# [fit] priorities

^ figure out what you want to prioritize!
^ this will help you make a thousand-and-one decisions

---

# make tools that are comfortable
# [fit] for you

^ practice this! it is easy to get discouraged.
^ spife is the fifth or sixth rewrite of this framework.
^ find folks that will encourage you.

---

spife is a thing, try it out maybe

---

npm is a company that sells goods and services

---

`npx @npm/spife init project spork`
