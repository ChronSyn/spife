# Ethos

Knork wants to make doing the *right* thing the same as doing the *easy* thing.
Knork's goal is to make creating **consistent**, **correct** RESTful APIs the
*easy* thing.

It attempts to accomplish this by:

* Providing **thorough** documentation, covering high level concepts, guides, as
well as reference material. *Knork can only be as useful as it is approachable.*
* Curating a set of patterns and packages and presenting them through a single
package. This flies in the face of the small module ethos *to some degree*, but
in some cases "batteries included" is not the worst thing in the world, especially
when trying to produce *consistent APIs*.
* Using Promises in order to retain complete control over the request/response
cycle. Authors cannot always predict where their service will fail â€” it's best
if the framework takes that into account.
* Clearly separating concerns. Depending on the scope of the change you want to
make, there should always be a clear place to *put* that change: be it views,
decorators, or middleware.
